# @reactutilities/store ðŸ“¦

An efficient and intuitive way to manage state in your React applications

## Installation

You can install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @reactutilities/store
# or
yarn add @reactutilities/store
# or
pnpm i @reactutilities/store
```

## Usage

This package exports two main things, `Store` and `useStore`.

### Store

The `Store` component creates a global state store and makes it available to all descendent components through the `useStore` hook.

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { Store } from '@reactutilities/store';
import Counter from './Counter';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Store
      value={{
        count: 0,
      }}
    >
      <Counter />
    </Store>
  );
}
```

It works like any other Context.Provider, accepting a `value` prop that should reflect the initial state of your store.

### useStore

The `useStore` hook provides access to the global state from any descendent component of the `Store` provider.

```ts
import useStore from '@reactutilities/store';

export default function Counter() {
  const {
    count: [count, setCount],
  } = useStore();

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(state => state + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

Any keys passed to as the initial state of the store are transformed into a `useState` instance, and can be accessed or updated through the conventional `[state, setState]` API.

## Type-safety

By default, there's no way for `useStore` to know the contents of your store. This can be solved by either:

Passing the store shape as a generic:

```ts
const {
  count: [count, setCount],
} = useStore<{ count: number }>();
```

Or by writing a reusable hook that does know the contents of your store (recommended):

```ts
import useStore from '@reactutilities/store';

export const store = {
  count: 0,
};

export default function useTypedStore<T = typeof store>() {
  return useStore<T>();
}
```

Alternatively, you can manually create a typed store with the `Store` type export, which essentially transforms the shape of your store into the return type of `useStore`:

```ts
import type { StoreType } from '@reactutilities/store';

export const store = {
  count: 0,
};

export type Store = StoreType<typeof store>;
```

## Details

This package is less than 50 lines of code. The only dependencies are `React` and `immer`, which it uses to efficiently transform the initial store into state.
